# Genome annotation

This container has the software needed for a genome annotation workflow that I am trying out.
* [RATT](http://ratt.sourceforge.net/index.html), Rapid annotation transfer tool - used for transferring annotations from a reference to a genome.
* [GFF3myEMBL](https://github.com/NBISweden/EMBLmyGFF3), tool to combine GFF3 and FASTA file into an embl file - which is the required file format for the reference genome used in RATT.
